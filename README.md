# WDI-Project-1

As a user:

1) I want to click on the uploaded images and select them.

2) I want to have a clear underestanding on how to start the game by pressing a start button or other ways.

3) I want to be able to clearly see the images and recognize the differences. Therefore, the timing on how long the images are showen is crucial and should not be too fast or slow.

4) I want to have the website upload fast and smoothly.

5) I want to be able to see the result of the game. Therefore, the alert message of telling whether or not I won the game is important.
